Back in December, I decided to subscribe to <a href="http://www.economist.com/" target="_blank">The Economist</a> because I've heard fantastic things about the magazine and the content it produces.  Suffice it to say, it's true.  The reporting both on current events and the global economy have allowed me to learn quite a bit about the goings on around the world and within the global and local economies that I'm not quite sure I would have learned otherwise.  The only thing I have to say, is that each issue is so jam packed with articles, I don't have the time or the chances to read every piece and sadly have to pick and choose the pieces I read.  I tried reading every article through the first 2-3 issues I received and suffice it to say, I ended up finishing those issues only to find 2-3 more waiting for me.  It was a lost cause sadly, and I really can't cram more time into the day with everything that's going on.

I bring this up, because the things I've been reading have caused me to develop a new interest into learning more about what makes the economy tick
