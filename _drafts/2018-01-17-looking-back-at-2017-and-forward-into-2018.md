## Looking Back at 2017

### What I did
I wish I could say I was successful at accomplishing my goals for 2017 that I laid out [previously](https://kpwags.com/life/2017/01/24/goals-for-2017.html). At the end of the day though, I didn't completely hit any of them. Despite this, 2017 was not a bad year. 

I've stuck with two hockey teams as I feel that's a good number. One of them, I even started up and ended up being the captain. It might be a little vain, but I rather enjoy seeing the "C" on my jersey.

### Goals Post-Mortem

#### Getting Into Shape
This one I did make progress on. I didn't really make much progress on the weight-front, but I was able to get my strength and conditioning up. My core lifts have gone up, I feel like I have more "umph" when skating and running, and I was able to run Broad Street (The popular 10 miler) in May, finishing with a time of 1 hour, 34 minutes which was just under my goal of 1:35. 

#### Reading More Books
Last year I ended up reading 13 books which was below what I was hoping for, but it did end up being more than 2016. A couple of years ago when I could read over my lunch break did wonders for increasing the amount I read. I feel like I kind of shot too high, too early.

#### Enjoying the Outdoors
Yeah, I failed at this one. Didn't do anything towards this one. Maybe this year.

#### Getting Back into My Side Projects
This one I can sort of say I've done. I haven't gone full bore into it, but I've been slowly reading into React and Node.js trying to learn the languages for my next project. I learned PHP using OpenVoter, so hopefully I can have similar success with this.

#### Writing More
Sadly, this is another one I haven't done all that much of.

#### Becoming More Involved in Politics
Yeah, didn't do much on this either. I attended one meeting of the local Democrats in January or February, but never really followed up. I'm still interested, but it's a matter of finding the time.

#### Disconnect a Little
Well, I moved away from Facebook. I haven't deleted my account yet, but I don't really visit it anymore...does that count?

## Onward to 2018

### Goals
I think I'm going to keep it a little more simple this year and focus on only four goals.

#### Losing the Weight (Finally)
This has got to be one of the biggest time honored traditions. People committing to losing weight January 1st, and then forgetting about it February 1st. I'm hoping to continue with this goal this year. Unfortunately, this did hit a little bit of a snag 2 weeks in as I ended up breaking the tip of my finger at the gym with a 55 lb. dumbbell...oops! Fortunately, it wasn't as bad as I had feared and I should only end up missing 2 hockey games, and 2 weeks of strength training. I'm looking forward to going back to the gym and being able to do more than simply run on the treadmill.

#### Reading
This year might be a little bit more of a challenge as well because I ended up re-subscribing to *The Economist* which is a fantastic source of news, but very in depth and not exactly a fast read. I'm trying to keep a balance between reading my books and the magazine.

#### Side Projects
I'm going to continue to work on my new project using Node.js &amp; React. I've spent a decent chunk over the last week or so, so hopefully this will continue.

#### Write More
Let's try this one again. I'm kind of hoping that given my separation of politics away from this blog and onto it's [own site](https://politics.kpwags.com) that I might be more willing to write what's on my mind without inundating this blog. Plus, maybe that will help me with some frustrations of what's going on in the government.

#### Everything Else in 2018
All too often last year, I felt like I was too busy or that I had too much going on.
