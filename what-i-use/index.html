				<h2>Computers</h2>

				<h3>Daily Driver</h3>
				<p>I have a 2015 15" MacBook Pro and love it. It's my primary machine where I do most of my development and other work. Given the complaints I've heard about the new ones, I'm going to hold onto this as long as possible and hope that Apple smooths things out in later generations.</p>

				<h3>Gaming PC</h3>
				<p>I built myself a custom desktop for gaming. It has a Intel Core i7 CPU with 16GB RAM as well as a GTX 1060 graphics card that I got before the Bitcoin craze. It runs every game I've thrown at it.</p>

				<h2>Mobile Devices</h2>
				<p>I'm currently using an iPhone 8. I liked the idea of the iPhone X but at the end of the day, I couldn't justify its $1000 price tag. The 8 runs great though so I can't complain at all about my decision.</p>
				<p>A little over a year ago, I picked up the Apple Watch Series 2. It's nice to be able to combine a Fitbit with a watch. The notifications at times have gotten a little crazy so I ended up turning off most of the notifications. It's also nice to be able to get info like the temperature at a glance.</p>
				<p>My tablet is a the 6th generation iPad. I wanted a tablet to read the news and whatnot, and this does the trick. It's also the first normal iPad to be compatible with the Apple Pencil so I'm excited to try that at some point as well.</p>
				<p>While the iPad does a good job for reading the news, I love my Kindle Paper White for reading books and long pieces. The screen is easy on the eyes, good in the sun, and in darker rooms.</p>

				<h2>Cameras</h2>
				<p>My main camera is a Canon 60D. For a prosumer camera model, it takes great shots. I love taking it out and capturing the world. I have the following lenses for it:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Tamron Lens</li>
					<li>Canon Telephoto</li>
					<li>Canon Wide Angle</li>
					<li>Canon Kit Lens</li>
				</ul>

				<p>I also have a Canon G1X for when I don't want to lug around my big DSLR. It's not quite compact enough that I can stick it in my pocket, but it's still a little easier to pack and carry around.</p>
				<p>I have 2 GoPro Hero 3's that I used to use for taping my hockey games, but I've since stopped for the time being and haven't found much else to use them for.</p>

				<h2>Software and Services</h2>
				<p>I'm not going to bother to list everything since there's so much, but here's a basic run down.
				<ul>
					<li>Web Browsing: I've moved back to <a href="http://firefox.com/">Firefox</a>. The new version is super fast, and their commitment to privacy is an added bonus.</li>
					<li>Email: I use Gmail as my primary email. I use <a href="http://airmailapp.com/">Airmail</a> on iOS and MacOS to view it for their powerful tools to help manage all the email I receive.</li>
					<li>Notes: I use <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear</a> as my primary note taker. It's unfortunately MacOS and iOS only, so it's not universal like other options, but it's simple and lightweight, and does the job well.</li>
					<li>RSS: I use <a href="https://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a> to subscribe to my RSS feeds. On iOS, I use Reeder to read them.</li>
					<li>Development: I do most of my at-home development in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, but will still use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> for some projects. I also use <a href="https://sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> to manage my MySQL databases. For when I need to do PHP development, I use <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/">MAMP Pro</a> to create local instances for the projects.</li>
					<li>Photo Editing: I subscribe to the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Photography Creative Cloud</a> package. It includes Lightroom and Photoshop which are perfect for managing and editing my photos.</li>
					<li>Gym: I use <a href="http://strongapp.io/">Strong</a> to log my gym workouts. I got in early with the app, so I don't have to pay for the subscription thankfully. It's a great, simple app to track weights lifted, but I'm not sure I'd pay for it monthly or yearly.</li>
					<li>Runs: I've been using <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> to track my runs.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Video Games &amp; Entertainment</h2>
				<p>I own quite a number of systems across the different generations, but primarily use my PC, PS4, and XBOX One for gaming.</p>
				<p>For streaming Netflix, NHL.TV and the other services, I have a 3rd Gen Apple TV.</p>

				<h2>Other</h2>
				<p>For better or for worse, I ended up going with the Google Home and Google Home Mini for my personal assistants. That said, I don't really use them much past streaming music, so I'm not sure it's really much different than the Amazon Echo for my uses.</p>
