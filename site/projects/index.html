        I've been known to play around with different tools and languages in my spare time. Sometimes they go somewhere,
        sometimes they don't. Here are some of the bigger ones I've worked on.

                    Ever have the back and forth with someone trying to figure out where you want to get food? Yeah,
                    thought so.

                    This random restaurant chooser was built using the Google Maps and Places API to get restaurants in
                    the local area and choose one for the user to go to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Google changed their policies for their API and I had to deactivate it. You can view
                    the source on <a href="https://github.com/kpwags/Where-Do-You-Want-To-Eat">GitHub</a>.

                <p>
                    OpenVoter was a social media CMS written in PHP with a MySQL database backend. For the front-end, it
                    utilized HTML/CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. It allowed users to run their own Digg or Reddit-like
                    site. It was discontinued in 2012.
