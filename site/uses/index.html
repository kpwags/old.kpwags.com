    <p><em>Last Updated: October 2020</em></p>
    <h2>Computers</h2>

    <h3>Daily Driver</h3>
    <p>
        I have a 2015 15" MacBook Pro and love it. It's my primary machine where I do most of my development and other
        work. Given the complaints I've heard about the new ones, I'm going to hold onto this as long as possible and
        hope that Apple smooths things out in later generations. I have it connected to a
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FBS36W2">Samsung 34" Ultrawide Monitor (LS34J550WQNXZA)</a> which
        I absolutely love.
    </p>

    <h3>Gaming PC</h3>
    <p>
        I built myself a custom desktop for gaming. It has a Intel Core i7 CPU with 16GB RAM as well as a GTX 1060
        graphics card that I got before the Bitcoin craze. It runs every game I've thrown at it.
    </p>

    <h2>Mobile Devices</h2>
    <p>
        I'm currently using an iPhone 8. I liked the idea of the iPhone X but at the end of the day, I couldn't justify
        its $1,000 price tag. The 8 runs great though so I can't complain at all about my decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        After my Apple Watch Series 2 screen broke, I opted to get the Series 5. It has everything the Series 2 has and
        a better screen. Sometimes I feel like I'm a little too "connected" using it, but I've turned off a good deal of
        the notifications to keep things calmer. It's great for tracking my runs as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        My tablet is a the 6th generation iPad. I wanted a tablet to read the news and whatnot, and this does the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the iPad does a good job for reading the news, I love my Kindle Paper White for reading books and long
        pieces. The screen is easy on the eyes, good in the sun, and in darker rooms.
    </p>

    <h2>Cameras</h2>
    <p>
        My main camera is a Canon 60D. For a prosumer camera model, it takes great shots. I love taking it out and
        capturing the world. I have the following lenses for it:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tamron Lens</li>
        <li>Canon Telephoto</li>
        <li>Canon Wide Angle</li>
        <li>Canon Kit Lens</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I also have a Canon G1X for when I don't want to lug around my big DSLR. It's not quite compact enough that I
        can stick it in my pocket, but it's still a little easier to pack and carry around.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have 2 GoPro Hero 3's that I occasionally use to record my hockey games when I'm in net. It helps me see where
        I need to improve.
    </p>

    <h2>Software and Services</h2>
    <p>I'm not going to bother to list everything since there's so much, but here's a basic run down.</p>
    <ul class="uses">
        <li>
            <strong>Web Browsing:</strong> Some might laugh, but I've been using the new Microsoft Edge. The browser runs
                Chromium and is fast.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Email:</strong> I use Fastmail with a custom domain as my primary email. I use Thunderbird on
            Windows 10 and Linux, and the standard Mail app on MacOS and iOS.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Productivity:</strong> I sync files using Dropbox. For notes, I use Visual Studio Code and a synched
                folder on Dropbox. On my iPhone and iPad, I use <a href="https://1writerapp.com/">1Writer</a> as it as a
                nice feature of being able to link to a folder on various cloud services. For tasks, I use Apple's default
                reminders app.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>RSS:</strong> I use <a href="https://www.feedbin.com">Feedbin</a> to subscribe to my RSS feeds. On
            iOS, I use Reeder to read them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Development:</strong> I do most of my at-home development in
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. I also use
            <a href="https://sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro</a> to manage my MySQL databases. For when I need to do PHP
            development, I use <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/">MAMP Pro</a> to create local instances for
            the projects.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Photo Editing:</strong> I subscribe to the
            <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Photography Creative Cloud</a> package. It includes
            Lightroom and Photoshop which are perfect for managing and editing my photos.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Gym:</strong> I use paper and pencil, copied to an Excel spreadsheet to track my progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Runs:</strong> I use my Apple Watch and the built in Workouts app to track my runs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Video Games &amp; Entertainment</h2>
    <p>
        I own quite a number of systems across the different generations, but primarily use my PC, PS4, and XBOX One for
        gaming.
    </p>
    <p>For streaming Netflix, NHL.TV and the other services, I have a 3rd Gen Apple TV.</p>

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>
        For better or for worse, I ended up going with the Google Home and Google Home Mini for my personal assistants.
        That said, I don't really use them much past streaming music, so I'm not sure it's really much different than
        the Amazon Echo for my uses.
