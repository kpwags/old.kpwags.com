<div class="content">
    <p><em>Last Updated: February 2021</em></p>
    <h2>Computers</h2>

    <h3>PC</h3>
    <p>
        I have a custom build desktop that I use for development and gaming. It's not the most up to date, but it still runs
        every game I've thrown at it. It runs an older Core i7, 16GB RAM & a GTX 1060 graphics card.
    </p>

    <h3>Laptop</h3>
    <p>
        I have a 2015 15" MacBook Pro and love it. Will probably wait until Apple updates the 16" MacBook Pros to their M1
        chips before upgrading.
    </p>

    <h2>Peripherals</h2>

    <h3>Montitor</h3>
    <p>
        I picked up a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FBS36W2">Samsung 34" Ultrawide Monitor (LS34J550WQNXZA)</a> which
        I absolutely love. It's awesome to be able to have two code files up side by side without having to deal with line breaks.
    </p>

    <h3>Keyboard</h3>
    <p>
        I picked up the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k4-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-version-2?variant=32287332696153">Keychron K4</a>
        with the aluminum frame and Gateron Red switches. I love its Bluetooth connectivity between my MacBook and my PC as well as its compact frame and number keypad.
    </p>

    <h3>Mouse</h3>
    <p>I have the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005620.html">Logitech MX Master 3</a>. Has the added bonus of being able to connect to 3 computers.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Devices</h2>
    <p>
        I'm currently using an iPhone 12 Pro with an Apple Watch Series 5.
    </p>
    <p>
        My tablet is a the 6th generation iPad. I wanted a tablet to read the news and whatnot, and this does the trick.
        The Apple Pencil support is an added bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the iPad does a good job for reading the news, I love my Kindle Paper White for reading books and long
        pieces. The screen is easy on the eyes, good in the sun, and in darker rooms.
    </p>

    <h2>Headphones</h2>
    <p>
        <strong><a href="https://www.anker.com/store/liberty-air-2/A3910011">Anker Liberty Air 2</a>:</strong>
        I couldn't justify the price for Apple's AirPods Pro, so I went with these and have not been disappointed. Good sound
        quality and the pure wireless factor is nice.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-ch710n">Sony WH-CH710N</a>:</strong>
        I got these for their noise cancelling and Bluetooth connectivity. The sound quality is good and the battery
        life makes them perfect for full days in the office working.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/audio-headphones-high-end-hd-558">Sennheiser HD 558</a>:</strong>
        I got these a long while ago and still use them while working at my desk quite a bit.
    </p>

    <h2>Cameras</h2>
    <p>
        My main camera is a Canon 60D. For a prosumer camera model, it takes great shots. I love taking it out and
        capturing the world. I have the following lenses for it:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tamron Lens</li>
        <li>Canon Telephoto</li>
        <li>Canon Wide Angle</li>
        <li>Canon Kit Lens</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I also have a Canon G1X for when I don't want to lug around my big DSLR. It's not quite compact enough that I
        can stick it in my pocket, but it's still a little easier to pack and carry around.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have 2 GoPro Hero 3's that I occasionally use to record my hockey games when I'm in net. It helps me see where
        I need to improve.
    </p>

    <h2>Software and Services</h2>
    <p>I'm not going to bother to list everything since there's so much, but here's a basic run down.</p>
    <ul class="uses">
        <li>
            <strong>Web Browsing:</strong> For privacy reasons, I've been using Mozilla Firefox for my web browsing. It's
            fast and its development tools are top notch.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Email:</strong> I use Fastmail with a custom domain as my primary email. I use Thunderbird on
            Windows 10 and Linux, and the standard Mail app on MacOS and iOS.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Productivity:</strong> I sync files using Dropbox. For notes, I use Visual Studio Code and a synched
                folder on Dropbox. On my iPhone and iPad, I use <a href="https://1writerapp.com/">1Writer</a> as it as a
                nice feature of being able to link to a folder on various cloud services. For tasks, I've been going back
                and forth between Apple's default reminders app and Things 3.
        </li>

            <strong>Photo Editing:</strong> I subscribe to the

            Lightroom and Photoshop which are perfect for managing and editing my photos.
