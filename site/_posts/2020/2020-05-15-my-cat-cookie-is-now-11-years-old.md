Meet Cookie, the cat that I’ve had now for almost 11 years.

<div class="centered-image"><img src="/assets/images/posts/cookie-cat.jpg" alt="My Tabby Cat Cookie" /></div>

In July 2009, I got my 2nd cat. My late cat, Nibbler at the time was a little over a year old and my girlfriend at the time decided she needed a friend. Cookie was about 7-8 weeks old when we got her so we randomly assigned May 15th as her birthday. She’s been ~~annoying~~ adorable ever since.

The scary thing is that it doesn’t feel like I’ve had her that long which makes me feel old...

Oh well, Happy Birthday Cookie!
