At the end of November, I ended up leaving my job at Maintenance Strategies, Inc. and made the decision to take on a new challenge working as a software developer at Webstaurant.

Changing jobs is often an anxious experience. You don't know if you're making the right decsion. Various questions often run through your head. What if I hate the new job? What if I think my new co-workers are jerks? Is it even the right decision? The worry is even more enhanced by the fact that we're living in the midst of a pandemic that has been going on for over 9 months with [the end only now starting to come into view](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/14/world/covid-19-coronavirus#america-begins-its-most-ambitious-vaccination-campaign).

I had been working at MSI for over 5 years and enjoyed my time working there. I had some fantastic co-workers and am ever thankful for the opportunities that I had while working there. Deciding to leave was not an easy decision.

My new job is with a company called Webstaurant where I'll be specializing in C# and .NET development. My first project has me using .NET Core, TypeScript & React. This is especially exciting for me since I'll finally be able to put some of the skills and knowledge I've picked up on the side to use in a professional capacity.

My first day was actually last week and so far, so good. I'm looking forward to continuing my journey as a developer, continuing to learn and improve.
