So I think for 2019, I'm going to try something new. I'm going to try to share a weekly list of various articles and podcasts I've read or listened to over the week that I've found interesting. So here we go.

#### [Techdirt Podcast Episode 195: The EU Endangers Free Speech Online... Again](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190115/12230841398/techdirt-podcast-episode-195-eu-endangers-free-speech-online-again.shtml)

The EU is working on a new law that could have many unintended side effects, especially with regards to free speech. While this is not US-centric, I can see something similar passing in the US.

#### [Radiolab: The Punchline](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-punchline)

As a hockey fan, I can enjoy this story about John Scott, one of the NHL’s last enforcers being voted a captain for the 2016 NHL All Star Game despite the NHL doing anything they could to stop him

#### [Test Drive Programming Fonts](https://app.programmingfonts.org/)

Check out some new programming fonts and see how they look. Download them if you like, they’re free

#### ["The Linux of Social Media" - How LiveJournal pioneered (then lost) blogging](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/01/the-linux-of-social-media-how-livejournal-pioneered-then-lost-web-blogging/)

I remember using LiveJournal back in the day…how times have changed

#### [The Rise of Netflix Competitors Has Pushed Consumers Back Toward Piracy](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3q45v/bittorrent-usage-increases-netflix-streaming-sites)

I’m not surprised, the draw of Netflix was that it was inexpensive and easy to view content. Now with having to shell out money to more and more services to view the content, the cost is rising which pushes people away. It might not be right, but it’s also part of human nature.

#### [The NFL’s Obesity Scourge](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/sports/football/the-nfls-obesity-scourge.html)

Everyone (rightfully so) talks about the head trauma football players face, but the weight gains that linemen need to do their job often fall through the cracks.
