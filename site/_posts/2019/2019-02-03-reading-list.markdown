Another week, another set of articles ranging from Apple's row with Facebook to the future of American infrastructure.

#### [A Tiny Screw Shows Why iPhones Won’t Be ‘Assembled in U.S.A.’](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/technology/iphones-apple-china-made.html)

Interesting article talking about supply-chain logistics that just put China ahead of the US for manufacturing Apple products

#### [Apple Blocks Facebook from Running its Internal iOS Apps](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203551/apple-facebook-blocked-internal-ios-apps)

Facebook went behind Apple’s back with its tracking app, Apple found out and didn’t like it. It goes to show that with iOS, if you don’t follow the rules, you can get unilaterally kicked off the platform.

#### [What Would Happen if Apple Fully Banned Facebook from the App Store?](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205291/apple-facebook-developer-ban-certificate-app-store)

It would be interesting if this ever happened. That said, it’d probably open Apple up to more questions about anti-trust and their tight control over the iOS platform.

#### [Fixing America’s Internet, with Susan Crawford](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18203591/internet-connectivity-susan-crawford-harvard-law-america-infrastructure-broadband-huawei-vergecast)

An interesting discussion talking about how America is falling behind in terms of Internet connectivity and what can be done to help correct it.

#### [Self-Driving Cars with “Cruise” to Avoid Paying to Park](https://news.ucsc.edu/2019/01/millardball-vehicles.html)

This is something I hadn’t thought of. Once cars become fully autonomous, there might be reasons to just let your car drive around while you shop. Reminds me of places where the parking ticket is cheaper than paying the meter.

#### [Apple’s power over Facebook ought to worry the rest of us](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18204559/apple-facebook-feud-market-research-platform-power)

The ability for Apple to turn off the ability’s to run apps on our devices is chilling, even when done with the best of intentions

#### [Will Sports Betting Transform How Games Are Watched, and Even Played?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/magazine/sports-betting-washington.html)

An interesting take on the future of sports and gambling

#### [Measles are coming back because of vaccination loopholes](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18204333/measles-outbreaks-washington-vaccines-state-policy-anti-vax-movement)

Seriously, just vaccinate your kids
