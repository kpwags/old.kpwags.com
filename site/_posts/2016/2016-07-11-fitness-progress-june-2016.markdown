June wasn't quite as much of a waste as the numbers seem to show. I want quite as active as previous months due to work on my dining room. In March I started gutting it and now I'm finally making some real progress...at the cost of trips to the gym. I've been playing a lot of hockey as well including 3 straight weeks of Sunday-Monday-Tuesday games back-to-back-to-back. It's been tiring as well given the late start times. As much as I love playing hockey, I think I'm looking forward to dropping down to 2 teams come fall.

My lifts haven't changed much this month as I've adjusted the routine I've been doing. Instead of doing a 4-day split, I've adjusted to a PPL (Pull-Push-Legs) routine. This has tweaked the number of sets/reps I do for the different exercises so I've had to adjust the weight levels. Happily though, I've actually started to near my highs.

My diet hasn't been too bad actually. During the week it's pretty easy to follow. I do still struggle a bit on the weekend so I will need to work on that.

Here's my progress for the month of June compared with the end of May
