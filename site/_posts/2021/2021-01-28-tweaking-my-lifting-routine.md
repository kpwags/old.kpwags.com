title: 'Tweaking My Lifting Routine'

Looking back at the last two months, I've noticed I've done a pretty good job of hitting the weights 5-6 days a week. Because of this, I decided I'd tweak my routine a little bit to help jumpstart some gains.

Since I [built my home gym](/2020/08/04/so-i-finally-built-a-home-gym.html), I've been running a 4 day version of a 5/3/1 plan mixed with the [PHUL](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout) plan. This has generally worked out well for me. I was able to regain a decent chunk of the strength I lost. Now that I'm lifting around 6 days a week, I figured I'd add 2 more days worth of lifting to my cycle to hopefully help make more gains easier.

I thought I'd share the routine I've built myself in hopes that maybe it'll help inspire you or give you ideas on how to improve or build yours.

## Some Terminology and Background

I base the weights of the 4 big lifts (Overhead Press, Bench Press, Squat & Deadlift) off of what they call the "Training Max" or TM. This is basically 90% of your 1 rep max (1RM), which refers to the heaviest weight that you can do a single rep of the exercise. So when I say "5 @ 75%", that means I am doing 5 reps at 75% of my Training Max. So if my TM is 100 lbs., I'd be doing 5 reps at 75 lbs.

You'll also notice for Mondays through Thursdays, I start with the big lift 5 @ 75%, 3 @ 85%, & 1+ @ 95%. That final '1+' set is the key set. That's what determines when I increase my TM. If I can do at least 5 reps at 95% of my TM, then I bump up my TM by 5 lbs. Some people only use 3 as the cutoff, but I prefer 5...it's a personal choice.

The other notations should be self explanatory. "3 x 8-12" means 3 sets of 8-12 reps.
