Earlier this year, I posted about how I was tweaking my workout to a [6 day program](/2021/01/28/tweaking-my-lifting-routine.html). That routine worked well for me, but then hockey started back up and I wasn't able to keep up. A new routine was in order, and I chose to build one based on [Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 BBB (Boring But Big)](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101077382-boring-but-big) program.

I've been running it for a couple months and I'm seeing some decent progress. I'm approaching my pre-pandemic weights on bench, squats & deadlifts. I've also set a new PR on overhead press at 155 lbs. (I'm not entirely sure if this is 1:1 as I was doing standing overhead press, but now I have to do seated overhead press at home since my basement ceiling isn't tall enough). That said, I never hit 155 standing so I'll take it.

It's definitely similar to how I was running my 6 day program, but it forces me to move up a little faster than I was in the past, which is good. It focuses on the 4 main lifts (overhead press, deadlift, bench press, & squats) and runs on 4 week cycles. It again uses my 1 rep max (1RM) to calculate my training max (TM) (90% of my 1RM) which then calculates the weights I lift.

For each of the main lifts, the sets are set up like.

**Week 1:**

1. 5 reps at 65% of my TM
2. 5 reps at 75% of my TM
3. 5+ reps at 85% of my TM
4. 5 sets of 10 reps at 50% of my TM

**Week 2:**

1. 3 reps at 70% of my TM
2. 3 reps at 80% of my TM
3. 3+ reps at 90% of my TM
4. 5 sets of 10 reps at 55% of my TM

**Week 3:**

1. 5 reps at 75% of my TM
2. 3 reps at 85% of my TM
3. 1+ reps at 95% of my TM
4. 5 set of 10 reps at 60% of my TM

**Week 4:**

Deload. I basically just do the lifts at 50-60% intensity to give my muscles a break.

I then up my 1RM for deadlifts & squats by 10 lbs., and the 1RM for overhead press and bench press by 5 lbs., rinse, and repeat.

The one thing I've been noticing on with squats and bench press is I feel like my brain is holding me back. There seems to be some kind of psychological component to it. Unlike the gym, I don't have access to a spotter so there's part of me that gets a little scared about the weights I'm lifting. I do have safety bars that will protect me for both lifts, but I always managed to lift heavier when I know someone is there to help if I start to go the wrong direction. Failure is a part of lifting and I have no shame in saying I've failed lifts on a multitude of occasions, but it's still scary when you have 200+ lbs. on your back or over your chest.

But even with the psychogical aspect of the heavy weights, one of the reasons I like the program is how it has me moving up in weights. The progress is slow, but it's steady. I'm obviously not setting PRs every week, or even every other week, but I see and feel progress while limiting the "scare" factor.

Anyway, here's the routine I'm running.
