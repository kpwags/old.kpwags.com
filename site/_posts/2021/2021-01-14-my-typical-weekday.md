I've seen posts like this going around so I figured I'd share what my typical weekday looks like.

<ul style="list-style-type: none; margin-left: 15px;">
    <li><strong class="extra">5:45am</strong>: Wake up. Feed the cat, take the dog out and feed him. Weigh myself and get ready to workout.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">6:15am - 7:30am</strong>: Work out. Most often, this is lifting weights, but I might hop on my bike trainer instead from time-to-time.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">7:30am</strong>: Make coffee, take a shower and brush my teeth.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">8:00am</strong>: Start work. I've only been at my current job a little over a month, so meetings tend to be all over the place.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">12:00pm</strong>: Go for a walk, a short run or the bike trainer when I can. Have a quick bite to eat after.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">1:00pm</strong>: Back to work for the afternoon.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">5:00pm</strong>: The work day is over. I'll generally cook dinner around now. If it's leftovers, I might play a video game or mess around for a little bit.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">6:00pm</strong>: Eat dinner with my wife and then feed the animals their dinner.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">6:30pm</strong>: Start enjoying the evening. I'll generally laze about. Sometimes I'll watch some TV, play some video games or work on my side projects.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">8:00pm</strong>: Start getting ready for bed. I'll brush my teeth and lay things out for the next day.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">8:30pm</strong>: Hop into bed and read for an hour to an hour and a half. Sometimes it's a book, sometimes it's the news, sometimes it's just mindlessly browsing the internet.</li>
    <li><strong class="extra">9:30-10:00pm</strong>: Lights out and go to bed.</li>
</ul>

This has changed a bit since I started my new job at Webstaurant and I've grown accustomed to it. My lunch hour will probably change a bit once it starts staying light out longer, but for now this has been working for me.

I'd love to see how other people, both developers and others structure their days.
