I still can't believe it's already April, it really seems like it was just New Year's yesterday. Alas, I figured I'd check in with how I'm doing with my goals.

## Staying Active

I've been doing a good job staying active. I'm lifting 5-6 days a week, I'm running more now that the weather's gettiing a little nicer. I feel generally pretty good about my activity level. My issue is that I struggle with the willpower to lay off the snacking. Now that I'm working from home, it's a little too easy to just munch on things here and there. I'm a little disappointed in myself sometimes, but I also do my best to remember that it's also not that big of a deal. I'm hoping to focus this month on trying to stick within my calorie goals.

## Improving My Development Chops

I'm continuing to learn both at work, and at home. I'm continuing work on my fitness tracker app. It's development is taking a little bit of a roundabout, which I'm currently writing a post to explain. The important thing is that I'm making progress and generally feeling accomplished with what I'm producing.

## Continuing to Read

I'm on my fifth book of the year and have mixed in keeping up with my _Economist_ subscription, so I'm happy with where I'm at. It's nice getting into bed a little early, winding down reading before going to sleep.

## Write More

I'll chalk this up as a mixed bag. I have a whole bunch of post ideas and some started. I just need to actually take the time to sit down and write them up. A lot of them are more in-depth than posts like this one.

## Everything Else

I ended up getting my first COVID-19 shot mid-March. I am getting my second this weekend & my wife is next week, so I'm happy to really see the beginning of the end of this thing. Hopefully more people can line up appointments and get the shot. I'm also hoping I'll be able to start playing hockey again soon too.

I also ended up re-doing my office this past week. I switched from an ultrawide monitor to dual 27" 4k monitors. I have to say I like the extra screen real estate. I ended up moving my ultrawide downstairs to use for work. Since both my wife and I work from home and regularly have calls, I ended up creating a second office in my basement for work so that we're not interfering with each other. An added benefit of this setup is that it gives me some separation between "home" and "work". When I'm downstairs, I'm working; when I'm upstairs, I am on my own time.

My wife and I have now also started to re-do the kitchen cabinets. It's a smaller home improvement project, but we're taking the cabinet doors off, sanding and re-painting everything, and installing new hardware. It's not exactly HGTV-worthy, but it should spruce the kitchen up a little bit until we get around to redoing it entirely.

Still not much to report, but figured I'd post this to help keep myself accountable. Stay safe out there!
