Recently, I’ve been listening to the latest season of [Slow Burn](https://slate.com/podcasts/slow-burn/s5/road-to-the-iraq-war) from Slate.

I listened to seasons 1 and 2 from them about Richard Nixon & the Bill Clinton impeachment and was impressed with their reporting and story telling. I wasn’t alive for Nixon & Watergate, and was too young to remember much of the details of the Bill Clinton impeachment so both seasons filled in a lot of the blanks for me.

The latest season, season 5, focuses on the run up to the Iraq War. I was in my freshman year of college when the US invaded Iraq in March 2013. I was old enough to know more of what happened in the run up and after the invasion. Despite that, this podcast has given me some more insight into what all happened from 2001 to 2003 when Bush started the War in Iraq.

I’d highly recommend checking it out.
