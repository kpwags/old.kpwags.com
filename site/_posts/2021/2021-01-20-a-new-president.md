Joseph R. Biden took the oath of office today at noon and became The United States of America's 46th President.

After the last 4 years of what I would take Trump's words and call "American Carnage", a new page has turned. It's gonna be a long rough road ahead as not everything is going to be fixed quickly or immediately, but somehow I still feel like my stress levels are a little lower.
