Every year, it seems the holidays come up on me faster and faster. It really feels like it was just Halloween yesterday. Maybe it's because I was so occupied with planning my wedding this year, but it really seems like the whole year has just flown by. I guess it doesn't help that I've just been so busy this December. With everything going on, this is the first year that Lauren and I ended up getting a fake tree. I've always been far more preferential to real trees because I love their look, and their smell. The fun is also going out and finding the tree and cutting it down. The weather never really cooperated for us going to cut one down, and we realized that we just didn't have the room. On the plus side, there's less of a worry that our cat Cookie will eat the Christmas tree and get sick.

Even with all the craziness of the last several months, I'm really looking forward to Christmas tomorrow. This will be my first Christmas married to Lauren (our 3rd Christmas together as a whole) and I'm looking forward to spending time with both of the families.

I wish everyone a safe and Merry Christmas.
