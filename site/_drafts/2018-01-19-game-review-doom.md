A couple of months ago, I noticed that my video card was seemingly on its last legs. The fan started going at hyperspeed and Skyrim would start getting sluggish. I ended up getting an nVidia GTX 1060 to replace my old card and wanted a game to test out the card and what it could do.

DOOM was that game.

I started playing DOOM 3 a while back when it was released back in 2004. I don't remember much of it, but I do remember that it didn't really hook me. I played a little bit of it, and then it faded into the background never being touched again.

I remember being interested in the game when I read about its release, and sicne several friends and coworkers recommended the game to me, I decided to pick it up on Steam.

### First Impressions

My first impression was definitely reminiscient of the old style DOOM I remember playing back in the 90's on floppy disks. Thrown into a world and just start shooting everything you see. I think the biggest thing I had to get used to was that I didn't have to reload my weapons. I'm so used to playing other shooters where the clip is of course limited and you want to reload to make sure you have as many shots as possible. 

DOOM works well without the reload mechanic though. The shotguns have to "reload", but that's more or less just limiting your rate of fire than anything else. The style of the game really is just shoot everything you see and ask questions later...it's not meant to be a realistic shooter.

### The Story

The game does have a story. I'm not going to lie, I don't really know much about it other than there's a lady who's trying to open a gateway to hell and you're trying to stop her. If you only play games for their stories, this game, just like every other DOOM game, probably isn't for you.
