Over the course of the last several months, I’ve been busy building out my website utilizing <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekyll</a> instead of Wordpress.  It’s not my first time moving away from Wordpress, but I think it will end up being permanent.

I do want to write more and I do hope to do so soon, but the fact of the matter is that in all honesty, I really don't blog as much as I want.  This lack of posts has the distinct advantage of trying in with what was the biggest difference to me between Jekyll and WordPress.  Jekyll does not use or require a database.

Instead, it uses files to identify the individual pages and posts.  Want to add a new post? Just add a file to the posts folder with a given filename format.  Jekyll is part of a new <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trend with static website generators</a>  and I have to say that for my current needs, this works out perfectly.

Because Jekyll just uses files to handle the posts, it makes backing up much simpler.  Hell, I can just keep everything in a Git repository and I'm good to go...which is exactly what I do.

As for the design, I decided I wanted something a little more simple.  I do love the cover images, but decided that want really what I wanted for the new look.  I decided I liked the idea of a short summary about myself in a sidebar with the main content in the main section.  It's simple, and in my humble opinion, elegant.  I didn't want to get rid of images completely and I wanted to keep something there to continue the "feel" of a cover image without actually having a cover image.  To do this, I decided to add an image header to pages and posts that was easily able to be customized, but yet still compelling.  I actually like it because I can change it between a 1, 2 or 3 image header very easily.

I still have a few things I want to do to improve it.  It is responsive, and looks good on both desktop and mobile.  The images however, could be better optimized, so I’ll probably do what I can to improve that for mobile once the holiday season is over and things calm down some.  I want to make a few CSS tweaks here and there as well, but nothing major.  The only thing I’m still debating on is whether I want to bother with comments.  I’m leaning against it at the moment figuring people can get a hold of me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/kpwags" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> or other social media channels if they want, but of course I could change my mind down the road.

As part of this change I also ended up moving my hosting from Rackspace to Amazon Web Services.  I've been meaning to look into AWS and finally decided to give it a try.  Having your own server is convenient, but there's something to be said to not have to worry about it when you're only running a simple blog.  I still have other sites on Rackspace, but we'll see how long they remain there.

Let me know what you think.
