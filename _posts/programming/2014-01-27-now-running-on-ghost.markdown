Despite my initial skepticism about switching over to Ghost as my blogging platform, I still pushed ahead and made my blog theme for Ghost. As you can tell, the look isn't all that different from it's previous look, but the backend is completely different.

I have to say, the way it handles editing is slightly different, but in a good way. I'll write more once I get more into the nitty-gritty.
