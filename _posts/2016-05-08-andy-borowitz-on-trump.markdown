I try not to get into politics in my posts all that much, but anyone who hasn't had their head buried under a rock knows that Donald Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the United States.  I'm not going to go into how bad this actually is or all of the awful things Trump has said during his campaign as they're pretty bad and I don't want to repeat them as they should get any kind of airtime.

I found this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/andyborowitz/posts/10154360492465681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quote on Facebook</a> the other day and think <a href="https://www.facebook.com/andyborowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andy Borowitz</a> hits the nail on the head with this.

<blockquote>
    Stopping Trump is a short-term solution. The long-term solution, and it will be more difficult, is fixing the educational system that has created so many people ignorant enough to vote for Trump.

It really says a lot about ignorance in society that we have a presidential candidate that disparages women, minorities, religious groups, and so many more only to be cheered on by society enough to get the nod to run for president.  Andy Borowitz is right though, that education, as difficult as it is, is the absolute best way to fix this.
