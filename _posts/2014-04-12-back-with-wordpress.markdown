At the end of January I decided to make the switch to the Ghost blogging platform.  I had heard good things about it and decided to move over to it.  Well, this past week I decided I wanted to expand a bit more with how I blog and realized that Ghost really wasn't going to work for what I needed.  Given that and my limited knowledge of node.js, I decided that I'd be better served moving back to WordPress as my platform since I am familiar with PHP and its inner workings.

It wasn't an easy decision and I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't second guessing myself, but for the moment, I'm happy with where I'm at.  I backed up my Ghost install, database and all so if down the line I feel like Ghost would be better suited for what I'm looking for, I should be able to move back with limited problems.

At the end of the day, this blog still gives me the space I need to express myself and that is what's most important.
