April was not a good month for me.  I was far less active than I wanted to be and wasn’t able to make it to the gym as often as I planned and generally have this year so far. 

The only real excuse I have is that I was busy working on the house.  A little over a month ago, I ended up gutting my dining room to re-do it so I was spending some of my evenings working on that in lieu of the gym since I’d be exhausted and unable to work if I went to the gym.  I mean it’s not the end of the world as I do want to have the dining room finished as soon as possible, but I could have been better.  

The destruction of the dining room has also impacted my kitchen as they’re right next to each other.  In an attempt to lessen the constant cleaning of the kitchen, my wife and I have been making crockpot meals since they require less cooking and are generally easier to make.  While most of them are healthy, some of them could probably be healthier.  Again, combined with the lower activity levels, my diet really needs to be cleaned up some.  I’ve been trying to cut, but my cravings all too often get the better of me.

The nicer weather has allowed me to get out and run a little bit.  I was going to run Broad Street, Philly’s popular 10 mile run May 1st, but it was pouring and a little chilly so I decided to pass on it this year as I didn't want to get myself sick.  I think I’m still going to keep my focus on the gym as I’ve been making progress on my lifts, and want to keep doing so.  I’m going to be on 3 hockey teams over the summer and that might limit my ability to make it to the gym as often as I’d like, but I’m still going to keep on trying. 

Here’s hoping that May is a better month for me.

Here's my progress for the month of April compared with the end of March
