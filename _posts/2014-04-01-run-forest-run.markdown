Well, it's official, this November I will be running my first full marathon. On November 23, 2014 I will be running the Philadelphia Marathon.

Last year I ran the Philadelphia Half-Marathon which was a huge accomplishment for me and I'm looking forward to pushing myself to the next level. 4 years ago I could barely run a mile and last year I was able to hit 13.1 miles. Now I get to see if I can run 26.2 miles.

The marathon will actually be the end of a big running year for me. I'm going to be running the Broad Street Run in Philly (10 miles) and two half-marathons. I'm looking forward to running all of these races and am really hoping to get in better shape.

Now to start training.
