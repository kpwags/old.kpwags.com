In an attempt to keep this site free from my political ramblings, but still wanting a place to talk about politics, I have decided to spin off a new site dedicated to my political opinions.

You can view them at <a href="https://politics.kpwags.com">https://politics.kpwags.com</a>

Don’t worry, I’ll still be updating this site as well.
