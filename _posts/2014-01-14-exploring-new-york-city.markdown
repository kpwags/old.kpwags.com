This past weekend, Lauren and I went to New York City. It wasn't the best weather for the trip, but overall I feel we lucked out as we only needed umbrellas twice. Most of the time it was just gray or misting which isn't too bad in the grand scheme of things.

The weekend was relatively low-key, we spent a lot of time watching hockey both at Madison Square Garden and at sports bars. We got tickets to the Harvard-Yale game at MSG and it was a fun time. We had no real stake in the game, but it was an amazing arena and a fun game to watch.

We had pretty good seats for it too as you can see.

The other thing we did was spent Saturday afternoon at Museum of Natural History. I went there once in elementary school and was bored out of my mind. I think there were two parts to why I was so bored. The first was that I was so used to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and how many of their exhibits were interactive. The second was that it was around the time when it was "not cool" to really read and study the exhibits, so trying to fit in with my peers, I opted not to care. Fast forward 10 or so years later and I've been wanting to go back to the museum and actually explore the museum for real this time. Needless to say, I'm glad I did. We didn't see the entire museum, but we saw a Dark Matter planetarium show, explored the ocean, and the dinosaurs.

I already miss NYC.
