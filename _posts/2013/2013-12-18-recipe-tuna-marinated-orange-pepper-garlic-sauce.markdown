So this was my first attempt at making my own recipe. My first time taking basic ingredients and putting them together, hoping that it turns into something edible. Well, it was most definitely successful and the tuna was absolutely delicious. So, with my glee, I figured I'd share the recipe.

**Ingredients**

- 2 tuna steaks
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 2 oranges
- 1 tsp. garlic & pepper spice blend
- 2 tbsp. olive oil

**Instructions**

1. In a medium bowl combine the garlic, bell pepper, the spice blend, and juice of the 2 oranges
2. Pour mixture into a seal-able plastic bag
3. Place tuna steaks in bag and spread marinade around
4. Let marinade for at least 1-2 hours
5. Heat the olive oil in a skillet (I prefer using a cast iron skillet for this, but you can use any skillet really.)
6. Cook the tuna undisturbed for 3-4 minutes, flip and cook undisturbed for another 3-4 minutes (It will have a nice pink center. If you prefer your tuna cooked a little bit more, just leave it on longer.)
7. Serve with rice and/or veggies
