It's been a while since the last time I've posted anything on here so I figured I'd give a little bit of an update as to what I've been up to.

Starting in January, I decided I really wanted to focus on getting back into better shape. This meant that I needed to start going back to the gym. Well, my normal gym routine generally has been 30 minutes of cardio followed by about 1 hour on the weights. It's actually a workout that I've been enjoying. The only downside, is that I don't get back home until around 8pm. By the time I get home, shower and eat, it's close to 9pm and I'm tired and don't really want to do much other than rest, relax and spend time with my wife.

The other thing that's been taking up my time is hockey. I'm in 2 leagues which has been keeping me quite busy. My C-League team didn't have that many games to start the season, which meant that in the latter half of the season, there are plenty of games. That, in addition to my I-League season, I'm playing 2-3 times a week. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love it, but it's been keeping me occupied. At one point I've had hockey 3 nights in a row. Come to think of it, it's going to happen again this Sunday, Monday & Tuesday. Oh boyâ€¦

I also signed up for the 2015 Philadelphia Marathon so I'm going to be starting to train for that pretty soon. I'm excited because the physical therapy and exercises they gave me to do have seemed to help. A couple weeks ago I was able to run 9 miles without knee pain which is a good sign as my 2014 marathon was derailed by knee pain at the 7 mile mark. I found a training program that should be doable and it's already entered into my calendar.

I also have 2 new projects I've been working on that I'll go into details about soon, but for now, I'll just say that I'm excited about it.
