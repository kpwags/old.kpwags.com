Many times while I am working, I often listen to podcasts. I find that they're a great way to keep myself up to date with what's going on around the world, or just to learn something new.

I used to listen to NPR a lot more, and I still do, but with all the meetings I'm called into, I seldomly get to listen to a full story or full episode. Now this is part of working so I'm not compaining, it just means that podcasts make a little more sense to me since I can pause the episode and come back to it at the point where I left off.

The app I use to listen to podcasts is called PocketCasts. It has both an Android and an iOS app. I like it because it syncs across my devices. I switch back and forth between my Nexus 7 and my Galaxy S4, so it's nice to have the episodes sync across the two. It's also nice because it will automatically download the episodes I generally listen to.

The only downside is that sometimes the counts go up to the point where it is difficult to keep up with them, even when I filter them down to the episodes I am interested in. That being said, I find that it does keep me up to date with what is going on in various different areas such as politics, tech, news, hockey, and more.
