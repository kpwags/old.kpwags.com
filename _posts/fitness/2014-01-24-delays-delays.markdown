This week, I was hoping to get back into my gym routine. I went so far as to do a double session on Monday in hockey (2.5 hours of drills) and was all ready to start on Tuesday after a few false starts over the last month.

Life unfortunately, doesn't always go so easy. Tuesday there was a pretty big snowstorm and did not feel comfortable to drive to the gym. Wednesday I was all ready to goâ€¦but then I got sick. Stupid virus or something knocked me on my ass until today, and even today I don't feel 100%.

Oh well, maybe tomorrow.
