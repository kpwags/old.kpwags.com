I really need to figure out the whole diet thing.  Other than that, I feel good about how the month of May went.  I was more active, between gym trips and hockey, I stayed busy.

In terms of lifting, I switched to a Pull-Push-Legs routine and so far I have to say I like it.  My gym trips are now a little shorter, but I feel like they’re more intense.  Prior to the change in routines, I was able to get my bench press to 200 pounds which is a big milestone for me.  I ended up dropping it 15 pounds to handle the additional sets, but I’m confident I’ll get the weight back up and surpass 200 on my way to a two-plate bench press (225 lbs.).

Weight-wise, I’ve really just been hovering, but I’m hoping once my kitchen is back up and running, it will be a little bit easier for me to handle meals and keep myself under my caloric intake goal.

Here's my progress for the month of May compared with the end of April
