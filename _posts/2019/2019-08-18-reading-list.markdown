This week I read about changes in the US Navy, another nuclear accident in Russia, a prank gone wrong, and more.

#### [The US Navy will replace its touchscreen controls with mechanical ones on its destroyers](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/11/20800111/us-navy-uss-john-s-mccain-crash-ntsb-report-touchscreen-mechanical-controls)

Touch screens might be good for some things, but for important functions in a military vessel might need something a little more reliable.

#### [Russian nuclear-powered cruise missile blows up, creating “mini-Chernobyl”](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/russian-nuclear-powered-cruise-missile-blows-up-creating-mini-chernobyl/)

Much like Chernobyl, Russia's response to the rest of the world has been less than forecoming.

#### [He tried to prank the DMV. Then his vanity license plate backfired big time.](https://mashable.com/article/dmv-vanity-license-plate-def-con-backfire/)

Seems like he got his just deserts.

#### [The surveillance state has invaded our cars. Why don’t we care?](https://www.fastcompany.com/90389104/the-surveillance-state-has-invaded-our-cars-why-dont-we-care)

It's just a matter of time until we're all required to have full-fledged black boxes in our cars outside of insurance companies.

#### [What Makes a Red Sky at Night (and at Morning) - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/science/what-makes-a-red-sky-at-night-and-at-morning.html)

An interesting and funny explanation of why the colors of the sky change the way they do.
