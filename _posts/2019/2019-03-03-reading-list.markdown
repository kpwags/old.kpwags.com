2 weeks combined this time as I was in NYC last weekend. This week I read about loot boxes, whistle blowing, YouTube conspiracies and more.

#### [How Loot Boxes Hooked Gamers and Left Regulators Spinning](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play)

I’m no fan of loot boxes, I much prefer just playing the game.

#### [The Personal Toll of Whistle-Blowing](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/04/the-personal-toll-of-whistle-blowing)

Blowing the whistle is never easy, and those that do have quite a bit to deal with.

#### [Can impeachment appear legitimate in a hyper-partisan universe?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2019/01/25/feature/can-impeachment-appear-legitimate-in-a-hyper-partisan-universe/?utm_term=.2643061d0677)

People often just say that it’s the opponents trying to undo the will of the people.

#### [YouTube Unleashed a Conspiracy Theory Boom. Can It Be Contained?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/technology/youtube-conspiracy-stars.html)

YouTube wants to limit the reach of conspiracy theories. Will they really go after some of their biggest YouTube stars?

#### [Why I Write CSS in Javascript](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js/)

I’m not sure that I have a strong opinion on this yet, but the React tutorial I’m going through uses Styled Components and I definitely see the utility.

#### [Why no Wall Street CEO went to jail after the financial crisis](https://www.marketplace.org/2019/02/26/economy/corner-office-marketplace/why-no-wall-street-ceo-went-jail-after-financial-crisis)

A little background on the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and why no one went to jail.

#### [The Dropout Podcast](http://abcradio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/)

An amazing podcast series talking about the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos.
