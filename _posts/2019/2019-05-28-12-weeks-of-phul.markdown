Over the last 12 weeks, I’ve been running the [P.H.U.L. Workout Routine](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout).

This is the first time I think I’ve stuck with a routine that long without some tweaks here and there. I enjoyed the routine. It had me at the gym 4 days a week which gave me the other days to get some outdoor runs in. My gains haven’t been as fast as I have done in other programs, but I’m feeling stronger, and better about my progress.

**Bench Press:** 200 lbs. &rarr; 210 lbs.

**Squat:** 230 lbs. &rarr; 245 lbs.

**Deadlift:** 305 lbs. &rarr; 315 lbs.

**Overhead Press:** 105 lbs. &rarr; 115 lbs.

Like I said, the progress hasn’t been as fast as I have done in other routines, but I’m also not doing linear progression like I was before. I generally have been sticking with the weight for 2-3 sessions, increasing the reps each week before bumping up the weight. While the weight numbers haven’t gone up, the volume lifted each week per exercise generally has. Even more important, I feel better about my lifts each time through the cycle. That said, I have struggled upping my bench press and deadlift weights, but I’m hoping to move up some soon.

The only tweak I made early on was moving overhead press to my upper hypertrophy day. I was noticing that I was having problems with being able to bench heavy and OHP heavy the same day. Whichever one I did first I generally did well in, but whichever one came second, I struggled and often failed. I think this is also part of my troubles with deadlifts. I do deadlifts following my squats, and am wondering if that’s part of the reason.

I’m going to continue to do the P.H.U.L routine, but with some changes for the next 12 weeks. I’m going to move deadlifts to my lower hypertrophy day. I’m going to add Romanian Deadlifts to my lower power day in exchange, focusing more on volume than on weight. I’m also going to switch out barbell lunges for Bulgarian split squats. I’m hoping to continue to make progress, and see my lifts get heavier.
