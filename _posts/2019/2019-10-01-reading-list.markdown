This week we look at a historical close call with our nuclear weapons, the OLPC laptop, the NSA going after ISIS, good CSS design tips, and ES2019.

#### [The Time When A Burning B-52 Nearly Caused A Nuclear Catastrophe "Worse than Chernobyl"](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29945/the-time-when-a-burning-b-52-nearly-caused-a-nuclear-catastrophe-worse-than-chernobyl)

I remember reading [Drift: The Unmooring of American Military Power](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BUG6T8) by Rachel Maddow  several years ago that mentioned some of our close calls with nuclear weapons almost going off by accident. It's kind of scary and who knows how much more we don't know.

#### [OLPC’s $100 laptop was going to change the world — then it all went wrong](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17233946/olpcs-100-laptop-education-where-is-it-now)

It's a shame this didn't really work out the way many hoped. This is an interesting read on the history and where they are now.

#### [How The NSA And U.S. Cyber Command Hacked ISIS’s Media Operation](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763545811/how-the-u-s-hacked-isis)

This is a pretty good read in terms of some of the things the NSA and US Military has gone after the internet/media arm of ISIS.

#### [Design Principles for Developers: Processes and CSS Tips for Better Web Design](https://css-tricks.com/design-principles-for-developers-processes-and-css-tips-for-better-web-design/)

Some good pointers for improving the look of websites.

#### [JavaScript: What’s new in ECMAScript 2019 (ES2019)/ES10?](https://medium.com/@selvaganesh93/javascript-whats-new-in-ecmascript-2019-es2019-es10-35210c6e7f4b)

A good summary of what is being introduced in the latest version of JavaScript.
