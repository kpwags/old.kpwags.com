I've decided to start this back up. Some interesting thoughts about making the data social media has on us transferrable, DIY Phone Farms, and a new software development podcast I've found.

#### [Don't Let This Get Lost In The Shuffle: The Data Transfer Project Is Expanding, And Could Help Create Real Competition Online](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190731/17390142693/dont-let-this-get-lost-shuffle-data-transfer-project-is-expanding-could-help-create-real-competition-online.shtml)

It's cool to see this still around. Being able to transfer your data between social media platforms might help with the silos Facebook, Instagram, Twitter & other platforms create.

#### [What's the big deal with IAsyncEnumerable in .NET Core 3.0?](https://dev.to/dotnet/what-s-the-big-deal-with-iasyncenumerable-t-in-net-core-3-1eii)

#### [Americaâ€™s DIY Phone Farmers](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3naek/how-to-make-a-phone-farm)

I guess if you want to make a quick buck, this works. It just seems like a lot of work to set up to me. It also reminds me of the constant cat and mouse games anti-virus companies play with the virus creators.

#### [Chats with Kent Podcast](https://kentcdodds.com/chats-with-kent-podcast/)

I found this podcast and thought it had some great people on discussing a wide range of topics. The entire first season is live now.
